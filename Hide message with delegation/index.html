            <h3>Horse</h3>
            <p>
                The horse is one of two extant subspecies 
                of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed 
                ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic 
                family Equidae. The horse has evolved over 
                the past 45 to 55 million years from a 
                small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the 
                large, single-toed animal of today.
